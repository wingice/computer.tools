** How to delete empty folders
What you need is depth-first traversal. With that, you'd start at the deepest directory and then move your way up.
find has an option for that, so you can simply run:
find /some/path -depth -type d -exec rmdir {} \;

You may want to additionally suppress the warnings for non-empty directories. You can add 2>/dev/null at the end for that.
With GNU find (and others like the BSD find on OS X), you can optimize the command – and run it without warnings – using -empty, as you did above.

find /some/path -depth -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;
